## Compiled vs. Interpreted Languages (Question d)

### Compiled Languages:
- Source code is converted to machine code **before execution** (compilation step)
- Generally **faster execution** since the code is already translated
- Examples: C, C++, Rust

### Interpreted Languages:
- Code is executed **line by line at runtime** by an interpreter
- More **portable** (same code runs anywhere with the interpreter)
- Generally slower than compiled languages
- Examples: Python, JavaScript, Ruby

### Python's Classification:
Python is **primarily interpreted**, but it uses **bytecode compilation** internally:
1. Python code → compiled to bytecode (`.pyc` files)
2. Bytecode → executed by the Python Virtual Machine (PVM)
This hybrid approach gives Python benefits of both interpreted and compiled languages.
